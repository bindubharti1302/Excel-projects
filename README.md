# Excel-projects
I took part in theforage.com's open-access JP Morgan & Chase Excel virtual internship. There were five missions in all:

Excel keyboard shortcuts
Task 1: Conditional Formatting with VBA Dashboard Data Storytelling

It contained a number of fundamental shortcuts that the company's employees use on a regular basis, and at the conclusion there was a quiz to gauge our understanding.

Task  2

For the second challenge, six explorations and sales account data were provided for conditional formatting.

Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.

 Task  3

Utilized function: VBA

We were told to enter macros into the identical sales data:

To determine which accounts have the greatest total 5-year sales increase, a macro can be used to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order.
To determine which accounts have the highest total unit sales in 2021, a macro can be used to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order.

 Task  4
 
 Tools used: Power Query, Pivot table and chart

The sales data needed to be transformed, and a dashboard needed to be made to enable data-driven choices. The dataset that the corporation gave was a combination of sales data over the course of five years and row-by-account data. To dissect the data and convert it into a row per sales year per account format for improved analysis, I utilized Excel's power query's unpivot function.

 
 Task  5
Tools used: PowerPoint Presentation

On the graphs we created in the previous job, they wanted us to record our observations using a template PowerPoint that they gave with us.

My understanding of Excel's features and how to use them was improved by this simulation. As I gain more experience with these tasks, I hope to apply this knowledge to my other projects.
